# Seller Optimization Platform

## Abstract

A clear and relevant product listing is key to e-commerce success, attracting customers and compelling them to buy. This project, "Seller Optimization Platform," aims to enhance the visibility and appeal of goods using NLP and Computer Vision techniques. The system features automated product title generation and accurate product category classification. Utilizing the T5 model for title generation and a multimodal approach involving VGG-16 for image feature extraction and a custom text embedding model for classification, the platform demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency. Built with Angular and Node.js, the app is deployed as a user-friendly web application. JavaScript and Firebase enable merchants to manage and optimize their product listings effectively.
